# Calibration routines for HICANN-X ('calix')

Calix is a library providing Python-based calibration routines for BrainScaleS-2 systems.
Currently, the typical calibration workflow requires the user to run a calix-based calibration and serialize the result to disk;
afterwards this "blackbox" data is injected as part of the hardware configuration when experiments are to be run.
